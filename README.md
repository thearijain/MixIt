Ever found yourself on the app store trying to find a DJ app only to realize the existing ones are terrible so you 
should just build your own? Us too! 

## Our first app!
Traditional music mixing applications lack serious features real DJ controllers have, so we decided to 
create our own. 

Hey I'm Ari! As a DJ I noticed the lack of features iOS DJ Applications contained in comparison to actual DJ mixers like my own. 
Hopping headfirst into Swift and iOS development, Komal([@kshriv](https://github.com/kshriv)) and I gave xCode a shot and loved the process. (Built for iPhone 8 because I'm broke and don't have an X 😅)



## Features:

• Choose from a list of songs to mix with

• Set a loop using the loop page to get a cleaner mix

• Set up to four cue points within the songs to jump around the track easier

• Access a sampler with four different sounds to overlay your mix with

• Use the crossfader to jump from deck to deck to get that perfect mix
